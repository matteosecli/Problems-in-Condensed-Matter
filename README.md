This is a repository for the course in ["Basic and advanced problems in condensed matter theory"@SISSA](https://cm.sissa.it/phdsection/descriptioncourse.php?ID=17), academic year 2016/2017.

The repo contains the solutions of the problems assigned during the course, including LaTeX source files and computer codes that have been used to reproduce the stated results.

The structure of the repo is organized in folders:
```
